# Community Garden Cleanup

Cleaned up the [[Wheelock Community Garden]] plot. Was shown the new location by Isabel. The two half plots I will have next year are adjacent to each other. With only the main wood chip path between.  Each bed is 20 feet by 30 feet.

# Planted Garlic

### Garlic Types

Planted the following garlic in company community garden:
- [[Silver White Softneck Garlic]] 1x
- [[German White Stiffneck Hardneck Garlic]] 1x
- [[Montana Zemo Hardneck Garlic]] 2x
- [[Music Hardneck Garlic]] 1x

### Compost

Used two bags of 1 cubic feet cow manure compost.  One bag was mixed into existing soil. The other bag was layered on top of the soil once the garlic was planted. 

### Garden Bed

The company garden raised beds are 6' x 4' x ??" (I'm guessing 8").  Each bed is shared. So actual working space is 3' x 4'.
### Layout

This template lays out the approximate planting of this year's crop:

An 8 inch gap was left from the siding to prevent cold/frost damage.  Garlic cloves were placed approximately 6 inches from each other.

After the layer of compost has been placed, moved wood chip mulch back over, then cut up some plants to create green manure.  Finally, placed a layer of cardboard for insulation.
