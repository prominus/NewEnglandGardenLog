### Description

This porcelain garlic is also known as 'German Extra-Hardy,' 'German White,' and 'Northern White.' Impressive bulbs are 2" or larger with white skins, containing 4-7 fat cloves with red-striped wrappers that are easy to peel. The strong, robust flavor has staying power but isn't overwhelming or hot. High sugar content makes these bulbs excellent when roasted. Originally from Germany, this long-time favorite was popularized by an organic farmer from New York. Especially cold-tolerant, this variety grows best in areas with cold winters and cool springs. Long roots help to anchor this cultivar deep in the ground, resisting heaving to the soil surface as the soil freezes and expands in the winter months. Good storage of 6 months.

### Sowing Info

**When to Sow Outside:** Garlic is planted in fall for harvest 7 to 9 months later (midsummer). _In areas with cold winters_, sow individual cloves from mid-September to mid-November. Garlic is frost-hardy but ideally should be planted 4 to 6 weeks before the first hard freeze to give the bulbs time to establish roots. _In areas with mild winters_, garlic can be planted until January.

**When to Start Inside:** Not recommended if you want to grow bulbs. If you don't get your garlic in the ground, the cloves can be planted indoors any time of year for the green tops that make tasty garlic-flavored raw greens or stir-fry ingredients.

**Seed Depth:** Plant garlic 2"–3" deep with the pointed side up.

**Seed Spacing:** One clove every 6"–8"

**Row Spacing:** 12"–18"
